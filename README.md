[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dtsomp/puppet_codetools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dtsomp/puppet_codetools)

puppet-codetools is a puppet module that installs useful Puppet coding tools.

The real intention is to have a sort-of-real-life puppet module to throw at Github and Travis-CI to learn their features.

In other words, this is a sandbox.
Proceed at your own risk.
